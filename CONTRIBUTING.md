## Setup

### Install Dependencies

This repo utilizes [Yarn PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) and [offline mirror](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#offline-mirror) to enable [Zero-Installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#offline-mirror). So by merely checking out the repository you have installed the necessary dependencies ðŸ˜Ž

NOTE: Smart IDEs (such as VSCode or IntelliJ) require special configuration for TypeScript to work when using Plug'n'Play installs. This project has installed the editor SDK for Visual Studio Code, but if you require a different editor SDK you can follow the instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks).
